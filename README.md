# Climate-Cost

Climate Cost is an open source community project to track the footprint of every single item. From a can of coke to your new computer. Everything has a cost and we should be able to know it as precisely as possible. If you want to contribute join our Discord https://discord.gg/tyxrtzr3Ez
